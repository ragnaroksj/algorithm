/*
Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

Example 1:

Input: 
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

Note:

    The range of m and n is [1,40000].
    The range of a is [1,m], and the range of b is [1,n].
    The range of operations size won't exceed 10,000.

思路：
其实找ops里面数组中每个对应位置上的最小值，注意ops如果为空需要判断
 */

/**
 * @param {number} m
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} ops
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxCount = function(m, n, ops) {
    if (!ops.length) return m*n;
    
    var minM = ops[0][0];
    var minN = ops[0][1];
    
    for (var i = 1; i < ops.length; i++) {
        minM = (ops[i][0] < minM) ? ops[i][0] : minM;
        minN = (ops[i][1] < minN) ? ops[i][1] : minN;
    }
    
    return minM * minN;
};
